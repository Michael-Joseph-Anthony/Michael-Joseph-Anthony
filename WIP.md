- Hi, Iâ€™m @Michael-Joseph-Anthony
- I'm probably a very unusual GitHub arrival, better late than never, I suppose...
- Have worked on Defence Radar, Communications & Automation projects, before the Internet or WEB existed...
- Developed control Systems utilising transistors, DTL, TTL, MCU's, misc. Hardware & Software...
- Amazing how much has changed and yet how much was 'MISSED'...
- I'm joining Github to provide some input - 5 year life cycles, must cease ASAP...
- The latest practices by Apple are beyond belief; however they are now back tracking to some extent...
- My Early 2009 iMAC GitHub Monterey worked ace until Apple used iCloud to lock my SSD...
- During my recovery attempts their cloud sent corrupted recovery emails and the SSD remained locked...
- Evenually the system became unworkable with keyboard speeds of 10 chars/second etc, etc, etc...
- Investigated the issues in detail - what I discovered is beyond belief in this day and age...
- The Git Hub projects on MAC OS are a credit to the organisation and we need many more of them...
- There are many more devices out there like Apple MACs, so let's get on with it...
- A specific development plan follows - a lot of work is necessary to produce a readable intro document...
- Believe me this is NOT 'Rant & Rave' stuff, by any means.
- Planet Earth needs us and we can do it.
- Wonder what 'Steve Jobs' would have said about all this if he was still around?
- He did say "Don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice"
- The inner voice here is to protect our planet against the dumping of tons of toxic scrap.
- END
